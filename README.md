# Service Quotation Management System

Overview

The Service Quotation Management System is a desktop application designed to streamline the process of creating, managing, and tracking service quotations for clients. It enables users to efficiently generate, update, and track quotations, facilitating better client engagement and project management. The system also supports client registration and service management, ensuring a seamless experience from quotation to project execution.

Features

1. Quotation Management

Create New Quotations: Generate new quotations with detailed service descriptions, pricing, and validity.

View Existing Quotations: Access a list of previously created quotations with filtering and search capabilities.

Edit Quotations: Update information on existing quotations as needed.

Quotation Responses & Updates: Manage client responses, track quotation status (e.g., pending, approved, or rejected), and make updates accordingly.

Export to PDF: Generate PDF versions of quotations for sharing or record-keeping.

Email Communication: Send quotations directly to clients via email.

2. Client Management

Client Registration: Register a client after their quotation is approved. Client information can be pre-filled using their quotation details to avoid redundancy.

View & Manage Clients: View a list of registered clients, including their contact details, project status, and service history.

Client Updates: Update client details as required.

Client Deletion: Remove client records as needed, while maintaining system integrity.

3. Service Management

Manage Services: Keep track of services offered by the business, which can be included in future quotations.

View & Update Services: Update service details such as pricing, description, and availability.

How It Works

Quotation Creation: The user creates a quotation by selecting the relevant services, adding a description, specifying the cost, and sending it to the client.

Client Interaction: The client reviews the quotation and responds (approve, reject, or request modifications).

Quotation Approval: Upon approval, the system prompts the user to register the client.

Client Registration: The client’s details are loaded automatically from the approved quotation, and the user can add any additional information.

Project Management: The project details are recorded, and the client’s data is updated as the project progresses.

Technologies Used

Frontend: Python (Tkinter/CTkinter) for a user-friendly desktop UI.

Backend: SQLAlchemy ORM to manage database interactions with MySQL as the database engine.

PDF Generation: Integrated PDF export functionality for easy sharing of quotations.

Email Integration: Built-in email service for direct client communication.
